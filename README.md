# Mogan Editor / [墨干编辑器](README_ZH.md)
Mogan Editor is a structure editor delivered by the [Xmacs Labs](https://github.com/XmacsLabs).

Mogan Editor is a **libre software** forked from [GNU TeXmacs](http://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/home/welcome.en.html), the major differences are:
+ Switched from GNU Guile 1.8.x to S7 Scheme (Faster)
+ Upgraded from Qt 4.8.x to Qt 5.15.x (More beautiful)
+ Via `Help->Mogan`, massive online TeXmacs documents provided by [Xmacs Planet](https://github.com/XmacsLabs/planet) and [TMML wiki](https://github.com/XmacsLabs/tmmlwiki)

## Goal: We create Mogan Editor for everyone to learn and create science and technology
## Target Users
### Developers
> **No Contributors and Developers, no Mogan Editor!**

The happiness of people who maintain and improve the Mogan Editor should be the highest priority. It is a non-profit project, none of us should get upset by the project itself.

We will improve Mogan Editor as a structure editor for:
+ Personal Knowledge Management / Note Taking
+ Code Editing
+ Lightweighted Markup Language **Live** Editing (Markdown/reStructeredText/...)

We hope that more and more developers join us, gain happiness, and help other users of Mogan Editor.

### Teachers
We would like to spend more time on bugs, features and plugins for high school teachers.

For high school education, Maxima, Gnuplot and [Eukleides](http://www.eukleides.org/overview.html) are the most important plugins.

For other teachers, we will also try our best to help them adopt Mogan Editor in teaching.

### Students
Teachers first, students are second only to teachers.

For students in college and university, Octave and Python are the most important plugins.

### Researchers
Most GNU TeXmacs developers are researchers. We expect that researchers are potential contributors of Mogan Editor. We will only select the most important feature requests by researchers to implement.

## 名
Darcy:

> Mogan is named after Mount Mogan[^1], a famous attraction in my hometown. 墨干(Mogan) literally means "dried ink". The word is derived from 莫干(Mogan) which is a combination of 莫(Mo) and 干(Gan)[^2].
