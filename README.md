# Mogan Editor / 墨干编辑器
Mogan Editor is a structured editor based on GNU TeXmacs.

Mogan is named after [Mount Mogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Mogan), a famous attraction in my hometown. The word 墨干 (Mogan) means ink dried literally while the word 莫干 (Mogan) is actually a concatenation of Mo (莫邪) and Gan (干将).

GNU TeXmacs is for Scientists, Mogan is for Writers.

## Plans
Mogan v1.0 (based on GNU TeXmacs 2.1.1) is a baseline release with the following three major changes:
+ Switch from GNU Guile 1.8 to S7
+ Switch from Qt 4.x to Qt 5.x
+ Change some of the default settings

Mogan v1.x will always be compatible with GNU TeXmacs 2.1.1.
