# Mogan Editor
Mogan Editor is a structured editor based on GNU TeXmacs.

Mogan is named after [Mount Mogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Mogan), a famous attraction in my hometown. The word 墨干 (Mogan) means ink dried literally while the word 莫干 (Mogan) is actually a concatenation of Mo (莫邪) and Gan (干将).

GNU TeXmacs is for Scientists, Mogan is for Writers.
