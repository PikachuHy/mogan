Mogan Editor is a structure editor delivered by the [Xmacs Labs](https://github.com/XmacsLabs).

Mogan Editor is a **libre software** forked from [GNU TeXmacs](http://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/home/welcome.en.html).

## Why
We customize GNU TeXmacs for everyone to enjoy it fluently and develop new features for everyone to learn and create science and technology.

## 名
Darcy:

> Mogan is named after Mount Mogan[^1], a famous attraction in my hometown. 墨干(Mogan) literally means "dried ink". The word is derived from 莫干(Mogan) which is a combination of 莫(Mo) and 干(Gan)[^2].
